# Neuroevolution Dodging Game

## About

## Neural Network
The neural network model used in this project has one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. The input layer receives four different inputs, the hidden layer has four fully connected perceptrons and the output layer gives three outputs. This neural network's diagram can be found in the following image.

'Player.x' refers to X-axis position of the current player. 'Block.x' and 'Block.y' refer to X-axis and Y-axis position of the player's nearest block. Also, 'Block.width' represents the width of that block.

Focusing on output layer, three options are given: move player to the left, move player to the right or don't move at all.
